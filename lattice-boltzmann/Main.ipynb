    "The Lattice-Boltzmann method solves the Navier-Stokes equations - i.e. fluid\n",
    "dynamics. This method maps the continuous fluid dynamics problem onto a discrete Cartesian grid where populations of fictitious populations stream (move from point to point) and collide (intereact and exchange particles). Each population of particles moves at a distinct speed: for instance, there is one population of particles moving one grid point East each turn, and another moving one grid point North-West.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will describe the test driven implementation of a Lattice-Boltzmann code simulation in [Julia](http://julialang.org/). We will put special emphasis on two approaches for designing tests. In practice, both of these approaches have a common goal; it is to simplify how we think about a piece of code, in order to create simple and efficient tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Mechanical* tests that simply check a function does what it does, without any regards or care for actual physics. The code to test is a transparent box with its inside mechanics visible. However, its input and output need not be physically meaningful (during testing), as long as the internal mechanics get exercised the same way. This may mean that we will substitute real numbers with dummy integers in order to avoid pesky floating point comparisons. Or we may substitute pieces of the internals with dummy agents: we care that internal function X gets called twice and that its arguments are such and such according to the flow of data within a piece of code, but we often may not care whether function X does anything! (Why? Most likely because the real function X is tested elsewhere).\n",
    "- *Domain-area* tests that try and implement specific situations with known outcomes from the domain-area of the code, namely physics here. The code to test is a black box that is fed physical inputs, and thanks to whichever wizard with whatever magic, outputs more physics. In that case, we will often try and reproduce expected behaviours rather than reproduce absolute numbers; e.g. what happens to the velocity when the pressure is doubled, or the size of the pipe halved. Going after specific behaviours is often conceptually simpler that attempting to check that every aspect of the state of a simulation is correct.\n",

    "## Description of the Lattice-Boltzmann model\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, Lattice-Boltzmann works by modeling the interactions of distinct fictitious populations of particles on a square grid. At time $t$, on each site $\\vec{r}$ of the grid, there are $f_i(t, \\vec{r})$ particles of type $i$. Each type of particle moves at a specific speed in a specific direction (velocity $\\vec{c}_i$), never wavering.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three steps to the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "The $f_i(t, \\vec{r})$ are set such in some manner that ensure convergence. We will not examine this step further.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collision\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, all the particles at each site $\\vec{r}$ collide together. Some particles of type $1$ will become particles of type $2$, and vice-versa. In practice, this means that the collisions change the speed and direction of the particles. In one approximation, used in this code, the new numbers of particle $f^{*}_i(t, \\vec{r})$ is obtained as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f^{*}_i(t, \\vec{r}) = f_i(t, \\vec{r}) + \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\left[f_i(t, \\vec{r}) - f^{eq}_i(...)\\right]$\n",
    "\n",
    "$f^{eq}_i(...)$ is the equilibrium number of particles of type $i$. It is obtained from the fluid velocity and density at site $\\vec{r}$ in ways we shall not fathom here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "Streaming means the particles move to the next site, depending upon the speed of each particle. *After collision*, the particles of type $i$ on site $\\vec{r}$ move in concert at the speed $c_i$ characteristic of their type to the neighbouring site $\\vec{r}'=\\vec{r} + \\delta\\,t\\vec{c}_i$, where $\\delta\\,t$ is the time-step. And so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f_i(t+1, \\vec{r}) = f_i^{*}(t, \\vec{r} - \\delta\\,t\\vec{c}_i)$\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one caveat however. What happens at the edge of the simulation? This is determined by the boundary conditions. In some cases, the particles will hit a wall and bounce back. In others, the particles will reach an inlet or an outlet, and something happens that will ensure (for instance) the fluid streams into the simulation with a given velocity, and streams out at a given pressure. The populations are then adjusted explicitly to constrain to the boundary condition. "

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope that this lesson has given you a few clues on how to go about testing scientific code. Designing a test can be difficult. That's why the main trick we've tried to illustrate is to start small. Check that one-line function, make sure it is correct, and lock down its behaviour so that you will get a fair warning if it changes in the future. If we had to write one of those _top ten tricks to spend less-time coding and more time on the beach_, unit-testing would occupy the first twenty slots. The second trick is the pivot: to take a step back from the algorithm and try and view it from a different angle. A physical property - `momentum` - has now become a mathematical object - a sum over a series. Or the physical flow between two plates is reduced to a function linear in one variable and quadratic in the other.  Eventually, it all comes down to one single piece of advice: keep your code and tests simple. If a piece of code becomes to large and to tangled to make sense of in a simple test, then it is probably a better way to go about it. "
